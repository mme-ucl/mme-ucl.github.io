### Beyond Lattice Energy landscapes in Crystal Structure Prediction
Many active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) exhibit polymorphism at room conditions in the solid phase. Awareness of relative persistence of different forms at different physical conditions is important for many reasons within the pharmaceutical industry. In this regard, our group is looking towards expanding the PyPol methodology beyond unsupervised clustering and identification of metastable forms using CSP and MD simulations, towards the development of novel algorithms which could analyse this data and compete with the classical entropy estimation methods in both computational cost and accuracy.


 
### Crystal Structure Prediction

Different packings of the same molecule (polymorphism) can lead to different physical properties, such as melting point, hygroscopicity and bioavailability. This can cause problems for the effectiveness of many materials, particularly pharmaceuticals. Hence it is very important for industry to know which polymorphs are likely.
Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) generates energy/structure/function landscapes of hypothetical crystal structures. These structures are ranked based on their lattice energy, with the most stable being the most likely to form. Energy landscapes (such as the one pictured) often have many more hypothetical crystal structures than observed polymorphs, but are still useful in assessing the experimental solid form landscape for small pharmaceuticals, such as galunisertib or ibuprofen.
