Crystal nucleation is a challenging problem to study computationally due to its characteristic length and time scale. We employ enhanced sampling methods that push the system toward nucleation by enhancing the probability of observing transitions along a _reaction coordinate_, taking the name of **Collective Variable** (CVs). An interesting and important research question is, how can we best identify and compute such a crystallization CV? CVs are typically expressed as mathematical functions approximating the system's degree of order/crystallinity. Such functions needs to be able to deal with all the complexities inherent to the nucleation problem at hand while, at the same time, being as computationally efficient as possible. Finding this compromise is challenging and an ongoing area of research in this group.
