### Machine Learning
In line with recent trends in scientific research, part of our method development efforts focuses on machine-learning/data-based approaches.  We aim to combine modern machine-learning techniques with a deep understanding of the underlying physics, to push the limits of modern simulation and modelling techniques.

### Enhanced Sampling
Molecular simulations provide the tools to study how the structural evolution of a collection of molecules give rise to macroscopic material properties, such as crystal habits and polymorphism. The timescales over which processes such as self-assembly, crystal growth and dissolution occur are typically far beyond the microsecond capabilities of standard molecular dynamics. Enhanced sampling simulations circumvent these challenges by, for example, biasing the potential energy landscape to force the system to sample regions of collective variable space that would otherwise be visited with very low probability. In MME, we develop and apply enhanced sampling methods such as metadynamics and umbrella sampling to simulate activated assembly to gain mechanistic insight and rates for these processes.
