# Molecular Modelling &  Engineering Group 

We are a research group based in the UCL Chemical Engineering Department. 
We work at the interface between physical chemistry and chemical engineering. 
Our research is focused on the application of molecular simulation methods to tackle problems in the fields of chemical and biochemical engineering.

We are particularly interested in nucleation, polymorphism and crystal growth. By developing and applying molecular simulation techniques to efficiently investigate these processes we aim at addressing open questions in pharmaceutical manufacturing and functional materials design.
