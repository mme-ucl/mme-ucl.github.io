### Theory and Simulations of Nucleation
Nucleation is a rare event marking the emergence of new materials. Understanding the physicochemical mechanisms for nucleation of liquids and crystals is important to control these processes and determine their rates. In MME, we develop and apply enhanced sampling techniques to simulate nucleation and overcome the timescale challenges associated with these types of simulations. Importantly, we have developed methods that allow us to overcome the finite size effects apparent in molecular simulations that affect the determination of nucleation rates and perturb the phase behaviour of nucleating systems.
