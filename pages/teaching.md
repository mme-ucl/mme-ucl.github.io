Our group is involved in several teaching activities: all PhD students work as TAs within the Chemical Engineering or Natural Sciences curricula at UCL. 

Matteo teaches classes in the second and fourth years of the Chemical Engineering curriculum. 
In the second year, Matteo teaches Particulate Systems and Separation Processes II, a module focussed on developing an understanding of separation techniques that involve separation agents and solids, such as Adsorption, Membrane separations and Crystallization. In the fourth year, Matteo teaches Molecular Thermodynamics in collaboration with Dr. Ozgur Yazaydin. 

Matteo also teaches classes on molecular simulation techniques in the Materials Modelling course organised by the Thomas Young Centre.
